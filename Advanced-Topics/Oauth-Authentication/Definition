## OAuth 2.0 Analogy (Beginner-Friendly Explanation)

Imagine three people: You, Jack, and Mary.

You and Jack have been close friends for years. Jack already knows a lot about you — the things you like, what you dislike, your favourite books, the genres you enjoy, and even some personal details you’ve shared with him over time.

Then you meet Mary. You and Mary connect quickly, and both of you enjoy books. Mary wants to know what kinds of books you like so she can recommend the right ones, but she doesn’t know anything about you yet.

However, Mary knows Jack is your long-time friend. Because you trust Jack, she assumes Jack already has this information — but she also knows Jack won’t share anything unless you give permission.

So Mary goes to Jack and asks:

“If your friend agrees, can you tell me what kinds of books he likes?”

Jack doesn’t respond directly. Instead, he comes to you:

“Mary wants to know your book preferences. Should I tell her? And if yes, exactly what should I share?”

You respond:

“Tell her the types of books I like — nothing more.”

Once you approve it, Jack shares only that specific information with Mary.

Mary gets what she needs without you giving her your password, without exposing your private details, and without Jack sharing anything you didn’t authorize.

Mapping the Analogy to OAuth 2.0

You → the User

Jack → the Trusted Service (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.)

Mary → the New Application requesting access

Mary never asks for your password.
Mary asks Jack for information — with your permission.
Jack shares only what you authorize.
You control everything.

This is the core idea behind OAuth 2.0:

A new application gains limited access to your information through a service you already trust, without ever seeing your password or full data.

## Technical Definition

OAuth 2.0 is a permission-based authorization framework that allows a user to grant a third-party application controlled access to their data on another service without sharing their login credentials.

It works by redirecting the user to a trusted identity provider, where they approve the specific access being requested.
Once approved, the provider issues a temporary authorization code or token, which the application can exchange for access to the user’s resources.

Important Note

OAuth 2.0 = Authorization
NOT Authentication

Authentication → proves who you are.

Authorization → defines what you are allowed to do.
