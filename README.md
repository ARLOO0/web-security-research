# Web Security Research & Exploitation Labs

This repository contains my personal research, hands-on labs, and practical exercises focused on **web application security**.  
All content is created by me through independent testing and publicly available learning platforms (e.g., PortSwigger Web Security Academy).  
No proprietary, confidential, or paid course material is included.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build structured, long-term knowledge of web vulnerabilities  
- Practice exploit development and payload crafting  
- Document reproducible attack chains and methodologies  
- Develop automation tools and testing scripts  
- Improve real-world pentesting and bug bounty skills

## 📁 Repository Structure


Each folder contains my own notes, payloads, scripts, and writeups.

## 🔧 Tooling

This section includes any tools I write or use during research:

- Recon scripts  
- Wordlists (custom)  
- Fuzzing payloads  
- SQLi / XSS payload libraries  
- Nuclei templates I create  
- Burp Suite configurations  
- Automation utilities  

Everything here is either written by me or sourced from open, public resources.
